# FAQ
## What about Linux?
My computer does not support Linux without installing it on my proper HDD. (Which is not ideal, as the Windows boot menu does not support it.) Buy me a better computer first.
## My Mac does not support the 64-bit architecture. What do I do now?
Your Mac is too outdated, go buy a new one. (You can even use trade in.)\
[> Buy it from Apple](https://apple.com)
## My Windows device does not allow me to open the file!
You might have forgotten to unblock the file first, or you have Windows S Mode, then update your OS to Home Edition. If you have Windows SE, forget about it, and install it via the Microsoft Store.\
